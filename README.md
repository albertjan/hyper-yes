# Hyperpower

Extension for Hyper that answers questions for you! Have you ever wondered why you're asked if you want to terminate a batch? Have you ever answered "No"? Me neither, then this is for you!

## How to use

Install [Hyper](https://hyper.is) and add `hyper-yes`
to `plugins` in `~/.hyper.js`.

## Credits

A deep bow to @sgraham without him I would never even have thought about this message. This is a low tech implementation of the reason he started cmdEx.
